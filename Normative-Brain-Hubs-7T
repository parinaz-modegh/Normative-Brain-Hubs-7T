# 7T rs-fMRI Hub Regions Analysis

Pipeline for normative mapping of brain hubs using 7T resting-state fMRI from OpenNeuro ds005747 (N=90 healthy subjects).  
Uses Nilearn for preprocessing/FC extraction and NetworkX for graph theory centrality measures (Degree, Betweenness, Eigenvector, Participation Coefficient).

## Key Features
- Combined atlas: Schaefer-100 (cortical) + Tian Scale I (subcortical) + LC probabilistic mask → 117 ROIs
- Four centrality measures: Degree, Betweenness, Eigenvector, Participation Coefficient
- Consensus hub detection: Regions in top 10-15% of at least 3/4 indices
- Results: PCC, Precuneus, Anterior Insula, DLPFC as main hubs; higher subcortical centrality in 7T vs 3T
- Reproducible in Google Colab Pro+
